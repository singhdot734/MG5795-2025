## Set up the class folder ##
#### Create a quick link to the folder
```
cd ~  
ln -s /fs/ess/PAS3124/ MG5795  
cd MG5795  
ls -l  
```

#### Enter the shared class folder and create your own folder

```
cd ~/MG5795/class  
mkdir name.# (your OSU ID)  
cd name.# (your OSU ID)  
```

#### Clone the course folder to your folder
The cloned folder will be the place you practice and run things
```
cd ~/MG5795/class/name.# (your OSU ID)  
git clone https://github.com/singhdot734/MG5795-2025.git  
```
